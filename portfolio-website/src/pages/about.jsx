                        I once turned a casual doodle into a fully functional interactive mini-game design just for fun.
                        Surprisingly, it became a hit during a team meeting and was used as an icebreaker activity to lighten the mood!
                        It reminded me how creativity even in small, playful ideas can bring people together and spark engagement.
